            <h2>Touring Chantry Island</h2>
            <p>
              As you take the 15 minute boat ride to the island you will enjoy the outstanding views of the sandy beach shoreline and the deep blue waters of Lake Huron. During your two hour guided visit on Chantry Island, you have the opportunity to climb to the top of the Imperial Lighthouse for extraordinary views of the island.<br>
              <br>Stroll back in time while visiting the Light Keeper's Cottage as it existed in the late 1800â€™s, decorated with period furnishings from private donors and the Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre. You will also see the surrounding gardens and many species of birds.
